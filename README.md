# AirBnb-Data-Analysis
EDA of AirBnb NYC Data set

Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting travelers with local hosts. On one side, the platform enables people to list their available space and earn extra income in the form of rent. On the other, Airbnb enablestravelers to book unique homestays from local hosts, saving them money and giving them a chance to interact with locals. Catering to the on demand travel industry, Airbnb is present in over 190 countries across the world.

The aim is to identify the parameters that influence property listings on the platform. I will use basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to explore and visualise the dataset from Airbnb in NYC. I will find the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on its location, price , room type and other relevant factors. I examined this data from various perspectives and came up with some interesting findings. This can help Airbnb's marketing, finance, and technical teams in making strategic data-driven decisions.
